# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to our Quantum Mechanics book!

Here, we will attempt to cover all of undergraduate quantum mechanics,
with some graduate content as well (to the extent that we've encountered with some topics). With this book,
our objective is to provide intuitive approach to learning quantum mechanics, and share with you the tips and
tricks we learned while we were studying this topic. Whether you're just getting started with QM, or are
already familiar with the content in this book, we hope that there is something you can learn nonetheless.     

Before we get started with the content, let's go over some basic elements you will see throughout this book.
First, this book is separated into three sections: the first section focuses on the fundamental theory of QM,
the second on approximation methods, and the third on some graduate-level topics. Within each section are
chapters, which contain individual topics. Clicking on any chapter will navigate to its content page. 
Second, we use a variety of colored boxes to denote important content, which we list below. 

:::{.theorem #thm-sample}
This is what a theorem box looks like. 
:::

:::{.definition #def-sample}
Important definitions will go here.
:::

:::{.notation}
These boxes are dedicated to highlighting specific mathematical notation that we may use.
:::

:::{.remark}
Any small remarks we have will go here. 
:::

:::{.example #exm-sample}
Example problems will go here.
:::

:::{.warning}
Read these! These contain common mistakes and things to be careful.
:::

We will also try our best to keep theorems and important results cross-referenceable, for instance clicking
@thm-sample will take you to the corresponding theorem.
Finally, this book combines elements from various books that we've encountered over our own journey through
quantum mechanics, a full list of which can be found in the [references](references.qmd) page.

One last thing: there is a lot of content in this book. If you find that there are any errors, or you wish to
make any suggestions, please reach out via email and let us know! We both want this book to be as approachable as it
can be, and are always looking for ways to improve it. You can find our emails in the author list at the top
of the page.
