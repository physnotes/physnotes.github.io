    "text": "What is This?\nThis book contains a comprehensive catalog of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics (QM), to the extent that the authors have encountered the topics and the material. With this book, our objective is to provide an intuitive approach to learning quantum mechanics, and share with you the tips and tricks we learned while we were studying the field. Whether you’re just getting started with QM or are already familiar with some of the content covered, we hope there is something here for you to learn!\n\nFundamental Structure\nWe have divided this book into three major parts, in an attempt to effectively compartmentalize the vast amount of material we aim to cover. The first part covers fundamental theory; specifically, it details the basic building blocks of quantum mechanics and helps us transition from the classical frame to the quantum one. The second part shifts focus to approximation methods. As we will learn, solving quantum systems exactly is nigh-impossible, which necessitates the need to approximate in order to effectively study physical systems. The final part will explore some more advanced special topics and extend beyond quantum mechanics into the relativistic frame.\n\n\nHow to Use This Book\nThe purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the foundations for a basic understanding of quantum mechanics. We will attempt to be as rigorous as possible when appropriate, but we stress intuitive understanding above anything else. With that said, this book is not an adequate substitute for any other reading materials or a university course. This, first and foremost, should be a springboard for further discovery. After reading a chapter, the hope is the reader has a general understanding of what was covered, to the extent that they can venture out on their own and supplement their knowledge with additional resources.",

    "text": "1.1 Blackbody Radiation\nIn order to dive into the world of quantum properly, it pays to spend some time looking at its history. In this chapter, we will give a brief overview of how quantum mechanics came to be. This way, you will appreciate not only the beauty of quantum mechanics, but also understand why it is necessary to understanding the mechanics of our world.\nThe content in this section is heavily inspired by Prof. Siddiqi’s notes for the introductory lecture in Physics 137A (Introductory Quantum Mechanics) at UC Berkeley.\nTo begin our story, we start in the mid 19th century. Around this time, Gustav Kirchoff (yes, the one from your circuits classes) was studying the physics of black bodies — an idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation, hence the term “blackbody”. Even though perfect blackbodies do not exist in the real world, their theory turns out to be a very good approximation to describe the emission spectra of celestial bodies like planets and stars.\nKirchoff’s contribution to blackbody radiation was his insight that the emissive power \\(R\\) of black bodies is determined by two factors only: the emitted wavelength, and its temperature. At around the same time, Josef Stefan empirically determines that the total radiation emitted by a black body is proportional to \\(T^{4}\\), meaning the total power across all wavelengths as a function of temperature may be written as \\[\n    R(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R(\\lambda, T) \\ d\\lambda = \\sigma T^{4}\n\\] The constant \\(\\sigma \\approx 5.68 \\times 10^{-8}\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. While this was known at the time, the functional form for \\(R(\\lambda, T)\\) was not known at the time. In the early 20th century, Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans use a purely classical approach and derive the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which is given as follows: \\[\n    R(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{8 \\pi k_B T}{\\lambda^{4}}\n\\] Here, \\(R(\\lambda, T)\\) denotes the power emitted per unit area. But, there is a problem with this formula! This formula predicts that at smaller and smaller \\(\\lambda\\), objects should emit an enormous amount of energy, due to the \\(\\lambda^{4}\\) scaling in the denominator. Based on this formula, the total radiative power that you would calculate would be infinite! Clearly this is not physically true, and this discrepancy is what is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.",

    "section": "1.2 The Quantization of Energy",
    "text": "1.2 The Quantization of Energy\n\nSo how do we fix our theory of black bodies? The key lies in how the Rayleigh-Jeans law is derived, and to fully appreciate why quantum mechanics is necessary to explain this phenomenon, we need to take a small detour. To begin, consider a square box of length \\(L\\), and we want to calculate the number of standing waves inside the cavity. These waves must satisfy the wave equation: \\[\n    \\nabla^2 \\Psi(r, t) = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\pdv[2]{t} \\psi(r, t)\n\\] Because it is a standing wave, we enforce that \\(\\psi = 0\\) on the walls of the box. Combining this with the solutions, which are of the form: \\[\n    \\psi(r, t) = A(t) \\sin(k_x x) \\sin (k_y y)\\sin (k_z z)\n\\] Our boundary conditions then require that \\[\n    k_i = \\frac{n_i \\pi}{L}\n\\] Now, to solve for \\(A(t)\\), we plug this back into the wave equation, which gives us a solution of the form: \\[\n    A(t) = A_0 \\cos (\\omega t) + \\phi\n\\] The \\(\\phi\\) factor here is not very important here; what’s more important is \\(\\omega\\), which satisfies the equation: \\[\n    \\omega^2 = \\frac{c^2 \\pi^2}{L^2}\\left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \\right)\n\\tag{1.1}\\] From this equation, you can then see that the number of ways \\(n_x, n_y\\) and \\(n_z\\) can be chosen increases with increasing \\(\\omega\\).\n\n1.2.1 Number of Modes\nNow that we have the full form for \\(\\psi(r, t)\\), let’s actually figure out how many modes there are for a given \\(\\omega\\) — in other words, for a given energy \\(\\omega\\), what is the number of allowed modes \\(N(\\omega)\\) we can have inside the box? To do this, we first define a density of states function \\(g(\\omega)\\), which is defined as: \\[\n    g(\\omega) = \\dv{N(\\omega)}{\\omega}\n\\] This way, we have \\[\n    N(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\omega} g(\\omega) \\ d \\omega\n\\] For a fixed \\(\\omega\\), the number of modes is given by Equation 1.1: it is equal to the number of ways we can choose \\(n_x, n_y\\) and \\(n_z\\). Since \\(N(\\omega)\\) integrates from 0 to the maximum allowed \\(\\omega\\), this integral essentially asks us to find the number of ways that the following equality is satisfied is given by the following inequality: \\[\n    n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \\leq \\frac{\\omega^2 L^2}{c^2 \\pi^2}\n\\] This equation simply defines the volume of a sphere of radius \\(\\frac{\\omega L}{c \\pi}\\). Then, since \\(n_i\\) must be positive, we must only consider the first octant (where \\(n_i &gt; 0\\)), which contributes to \\(1 / 8\\)-th of the volume of the sphere. As such, \\(N(\\omega)\\) is: \\[\n    N(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{8}\\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\frac{\\omega^3 L^3}{c^3 \\pi^3} \\right)  = \\frac{\\omega^3\n    V}{6 c^3\\pi^2}\n\\] Here, \\(V = L^3\\) denotes the volume of the box. Converting this to linear frequency using \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\), we get: \\[\n    N(f) = \\frac{8 \\pi^3 f^3 V}{6 c^3 \\pi} \\implies g(f) = \\dv{N(f)}{f} = \\frac{4\\pi f^2V}{c^3}\n\\] Now one final subtlety: each mode has two polarization directions (you can think of this as linearly and circularly polarized light), so we have to multiply this \\(g(f)\\) by 2 to get the full relation: \\[\n    g(f) = \\frac{8 \\pi f^2}{c^3} V\n\\] So far, we haven’t used made any assumptions from either classical or quantum mechanics — we have made only mathematical arguments up to this point. As we will see, this is where the differences end.\n\n\n1.2.2 Finding Energy Density\nWhen Rayleigh and Jeans derived their formula, they assumed classically that all modes exist and have energy \\(k_BT\\); this is a property given to us by the equipartition theorem.1 Using this assumption, we then know that the number of modes between \\(f\\) and \\(f + d f\\) is given by \\[\n    g(f) k_BT \\ d f = \\frac{8\\pi}{c^3} f^2 V k_BT  \\ d f\n\\] Now, you get purely the energy density by dividing by the volume: \\[\n    \\rho(f) = \\frac{8 \\pi}{c^3} f^2 k_BT \\ d f\n\\] Changing this into an expression involving \\(\\lambda\\) gives: \\[\n    \\rho(\\lambda) = \\frac{8\\pi}{c^3} \\frac{c^2}{\\lambda^2} \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2} k_BT = \\frac{8 \\pi\n    k_BT}{\\lambda^{4}}\n\\] which is precisely the energy density given by the Rayleigh-Jeans law, giving us the ultraviolet catastrophe. However, if we instead assume that not all modes exist but that energy is quantized, a different result appears. This is the assumption that Max Planck made, and it is what allows us to arrive at the Planck radiation formula. In particular, Planck assumed that energy may only be gained and lost in units of \\(hf\\) (called quanta) where \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant. This is what we nowadays call quantizing the energy, and using this assumption to calculate the density of states gives us the following formula for the energy density: \\[\n    \\rho(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{8 \\pi h c}{\\lambda^{5}} \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_BT}) - 1}\n\\] This is the Planck Radiation formula, and unlike the Rayleigh-Jeans law, it does agree very well with experimental data.\nSo what’s the takeaway from all this? In this derivation, we had to use the assumption that energy was quantized to arrive at the correct formula for the energy density, as our classical methods failed. Hopefully through this example you can see why we need to study quantum mechanics: without it, our picture of the world would be incomplete!",

    "section": "1.3 The Photoelectric Effect",
    "text": "1.3 The Photoelectric Effect\nLike the Planck radiation formula, the explanation of the photoelectric effect is also one that requires the assumption that energy is quantized. Famously, it was Einstein who proposed the correct mechanism for this phenomenon, which was ultimately the contribution that won him the Nobel prize, not his contributions of special and general relativity.\nThe photoelectric effect can be described as follows: when you shine light onto a metal surface, the light transfers energy onto the electrons trapped inside the metal, eventually transferring enough energy to allow them to “escape” the metal, resulting in a phenomenon called photoemission. Naturally, if light were to gradually transfer energy to these electrons, you should expect that even if the light were dim and low energy (e.g. microwave wavelength), the electrons would accumulate energy and eventually reach an energy which allows photoemission to occur. In reality however, not all wavelengths of light generates photoemission, no matter the intensity and duration of exposure.\nSo how do we explain this phenomenon? Einstein put forward the postulate that instead of treating light as a continuous beam of energy but instead quantizing it, this phenomenon can be explained. Specifically, we can imagine light as a stream of particles (called quanta), each carrying an energy \\(E = hf\\) which it can impart to the electrons in the metal. He then theorized that there must be a minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the metal, called the work function \\(\\phi\\). Since a photon can only deliver energy \\(hf\\) to the electron, this solves the frequency-dependent effect we couldn’t explain from earlier. This also explains why changing the intensity nor duration matter: the energy of the light quanta is only frequency dependent, hence varying things like the intensity or duration have no bearing on photoemission.",

The photoelectric effect cannot be explained without accepting that light is quantized, and likewise the emission spectra of black bodies is impossible to account for without allowing for energy to be quantized.\nNow that you’ve gotten an appreciation for the importance of quantum mechanics, let’s now move on to develop the formal mathematics of quantum mechanics.",
