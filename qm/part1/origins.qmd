# History of Quantum Mechanics

In order to dive into the world of quantum properly, it pays to spend some time looking at its history. In
this chapter, we will give a brief overview of how quantum mechanics came to be. This way, you will
appreciate not only the beauty of quantum mechanics, but also understand why it is necessary to understanding
the mechanics of our world. 

The content in this section is heavily inspired by Prof. Siddiqi's notes for the introductory lecture in
Physics 137A (Introductory Quantum Mechanics) at UC Berkeley. 

## Blackbody Radiation
To begin our story, we start in the mid 19th century. Around this time, Gustav Kirchoff (yes, the one from your
circuits classes) was studying the physics of black bodies --- an idealized object that absorbs *all*
electromagnetic radiation, hence the term "blackbody". Even though perfect blackbodies do not exist in the
real world, their theory turns out to be a very good approximation to describe the emission spectra of
celestial bodies like planets and stars. 

Kirchoff's contribution to blackbody radiation was his insight that the emissive power $R$ of black bodies is
determined by two factors only: the emitted wavelength, and its temperature. At around the same time, Josef Stefan
empirically determines that the total radiation emitted by a black body is proportional to $T^{4}$, meaning
the total power across all wavelengths as a function of temperature may be written as 
$$
	R(T) = \int_{0}^{\infty} R(\lambda, T) \ d\lambda = \sigma T^{4}
$$
The constant $\sigma \approx 5.68 \times 10^{-8}$ is the **Stefan-Boltzmann constant**. While this was known
at the time, the functional form for $R(\lambda, T)$ was not known at the time. In the early 20th century,
Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans use a purely classical approach and derive the *Rayleigh-Jeans law*, which is
given as follows:
$$
	R(\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi k_B T}{\lambda^{4}}
$$
Here, $R(\lambda, T)$ denotes the power emitted per unit area. But, there is a problem with this formula!
This formula predicts that at smaller and smaller $\lambda$, objects should emit an enormous amount of
energy, due to the $\lambda^{4}$ scaling in the denominator. Based on this formula, the total radiative power
that you would calculate would be infinite! Clearly this is not physically true, and this discrepancy is
what is known as the **ultraviolet catastrophe**.

## The Quantization of Energy
<!-- NOTE: I did go through the full derviation here; if you think it's too long, feel free to cut some of
this out.  -->
So how do we fix our theory of black bodies? The key lies in how the Rayleigh-Jeans law is derived, and to
fully appreciate why quantum mechanics is necessary to explain this phenomenon, we need to take a small
detour. To begin, consider a square box of length $L$, and we want to calculate
the number of **standing waves** inside the cavity. These waves must satisfy the wave equation:
$$
	\nabla^2 \Psi(r, t) = \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv[2]{t} \psi(r, t)
$$
Because it is a standing wave, we enforce that $\psi = 0$ on the walls of the box. Combining this with the
solutions, which are of the form:
$$
	\psi(r, t) = A(t) \sin(k_x x) \sin (k_y y)\sin (k_z z)
$$
Our boundary conditions then require that 
$$
	k_i = \frac{n_i \pi}{L}
$$
Now, to solve for $A(t)$, we plug this back into the wave equation, which gives us a solution of the form:
$$
	A(t) = A_0 \cos (\omega t) + \phi
$$
The $\phi$ factor here is not very important here; what's more important is $\omega$, which satisfies the
equation:
$$
	\omega^2 = \frac{c^2 \pi^2}{L^2}\left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \right)
$${#eq-num-modes-precursor}
From this equation, you can then see that the number of ways $n_x, n_y$ and $n_z$ can be chosen increases
with increasing $\omega$. 

### Number of Modes
Now that we have the full form for $\psi(r, t)$, let's actually figure out how many modes there are
for a given $\omega$ --- in other words, for a given energy $\omega$, what is the number of allowed 
modes $N(\omega)$ we can have inside the box? To do this, we first define a *density of states* function
$g(\omega)$, which is defined as:
$$
	g(\omega) = \dv{N(\omega)}{\omega}
$$
This way, we have 
$$
	N(\omega) = \int_{0}^{\omega} g(\omega) \ d \omega
$$
For a fixed $\omega$, the number of modes is given by @eq-num-modes-precursor: it is equal to the number of ways we can
choose $n_x, n_y$ and $n_z$. Since $N(\omega)$ integrates from 0 to the maximum allowed $\omega$, this
integral essentially asks us to find the number of ways that the following equality is satisfied is given by
the following inequality:
$$
	n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \leq \frac{\omega^2 L^2}{c^2 \pi^2}
$$
This equation simply defines the volume of a sphere of radius $\frac{\omega L}{c \pi}$. Then, since $n_i$
must be positive, we must only consider the first octant (where $n_i > 0$), which contributes to $1 / 8$-th
of the volume of the sphere. As such, $N(\omega)$ is:
$$
	N(\omega) = \frac{1}{8}\left( \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{\omega^3 L^3}{c^3 \pi^3} \right)  = \frac{\omega^3
	V}{6 c^3\pi^2}
$$
Here, $V = L^3$ denotes the volume of the box. Converting this to linear frequency using $\omega = 2\pi f$, we get:
$$
	N(f) = \frac{8 \pi^3 f^3 V}{6 c^3 \pi} \implies g(f) = \dv{N(f)}{f} = \frac{4\pi f^2V}{c^3}
$$
Now one final subtlety: each mode has two polarization directions (you can think of this as linearly and
circularly polarized light), so we have to multiply this $g(f)$ by 2 to get the full relation:
$$
	g(f) = \frac{8 \pi f^2}{c^3} V
$$
So far, we haven't used made any assumptions from either classical or quantum mechanics --- we have made only
mathematical arguments up to this point. As we will see, this is where the differences end. 

### Finding Energy Density
When Rayleigh and Jeans derived their formula, they assumed classically that all modes exist and have energy
$k_BT$; this is a property given to us by the equipartition theorem.[^1] Using this assumption, we then know
that the number of modes between $f$ and $f + d f$ is given by 
$$
	g(f) k_BT \ d f = \frac{8\pi}{c^3} f^2 V k_BT  \ d f
$$
Now, you get purely the energy density by dividing by the volume:
$$
	\rho(f) = \frac{8 \pi}{c^3} f^2 k_BT \ d f
$$
Changing this into an expression involving $\lambda$ gives:
$$
	\rho(\lambda) = \frac{8\pi}{c^3} \frac{c^2}{\lambda^2} \frac{c}{\lambda^2} k_BT = \frac{8 \pi
	k_BT}{\lambda^{4}}
$$
which is precisely the energy density given by the Rayleigh-Jeans law, giving us the ultraviolet catastrophe.
However, if we instead assume that not *all* modes exist but that energy is **quantized**, a different result
appears. This is the assumption that Max Planck made, and it is what allows us to arrive at the Planck
radiation formula. In particular, Planck assumed that energy may only be gained and lost in units of $hf$
(called *quanta*) where $h$ is Planck's constant. This is what we nowadays call **quantizing the energy**,
and using this assumption to calculate the density of states gives us the following formula for the energy
density:
$$
	\rho(\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi h c}{\lambda^{5}} \frac{1}{\exp(\frac{h c}{\lambda k_BT}) - 1}
$$
This is the **Planck Radiation formula**, and unlike the Rayleigh-Jeans law, it does agree very well with
experimental data.   

So what's the takeaway from all this? In this derivation, we had to use the assumption that energy was
quantized to arrive at the correct formula for the energy density, as our classical methods failed. Hopefully
through this example you can see why we need to study quantum mechanics: without it, our picture of the world
would be incomplete!

## The Photoelectric Effect

Like the Planck radiation formula, the explanation of the photoelectric effect is also one that requires the
assumption that energy is quantized. Famously, it was Einstein who proposed the correct mechanism for this
phenomenon, which was ultimately the contribution that won him the Nobel prize, not his contributions of
special and general relativity. 

The photoelectric effect can be described as follows: when you shine light onto a metal surface, the light
transfers energy onto the electrons trapped inside the metal, eventually transferring enough energy to allow
them to "escape" the metal, resulting in a phenomenon called *photoemission*. Naturally, if light were to
gradually transfer energy to these electrons, you should expect that even if the light were dim and low
energy (e.g. microwave wavelength), the electrons would accumulate energy and eventually reach an energy
which allows photoemission to occur. In reality however, not all wavelengths of light generates
photoemission, no matter the intensity and duration of exposure.  

So how do we explain this phenomenon? Einstein put forward the postulate that instead of treating light as a
continuous beam of energy but instead **quantizing** it, this phenomenon can be explained. Specifically, we
can imagine light as a stream of particles (called **quanta**), each carrying an energy $E = hf$ which it can
impart to the electrons in the metal. He then theorized that there must be a minimum amount of energy
required to remove an electron from the metal, called the *work function* $\phi$. Since a photon can only
deliver energy $hf$ to the electron, this solves the frequency-dependent effect we couldn't explain from
earlier. This also explains why changing the intensity nor duration matter: the energy of the light quanta is
only frequency dependent, hence varying things like the intensity or duration have no bearing on
photoemission.  

## Conclusion
Hopefully through these two examples you can now see how important quantum mechanics is to our modern
understanding of the world: without it, many phenomena we see around us simply cannot be explained. The
photoelectric effect cannot be explained without accepting that light is quantized, and likewise the emission
spectra of black bodies is impossible to account for without allowing for energy to be quantized.  

Now that you've gotten an appreciation for the importance of quantum mechanics, let's now move on to
develop the formal mathematics of quantum mechanics.

[^1]: The equipartition theorem says that the average of any quadratic degree of freedom is $\frac{1}{2}
	k_BT$. In short, the reason why each mode contributes $k_BT$ is because harmonic oscillators have two
	quadratic degrees of freedom --- one in position, the other in momentum. Each contributes $\frac{1}{2}
	k_BT$, so in total each mode contributes $k_BT$. For a more detailed explanation, consult a statistical
	mechanics book.
